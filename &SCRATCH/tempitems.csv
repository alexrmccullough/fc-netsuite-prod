Let's just say it's made with the real thing, and there's a reason it's a crowd favorite. Like our other flavors, it's rich, smooth, creamy and perfectly balanced, not too bitter, not too sweet. The perfect pint, brewed up fresh for casual coffee drinkers and connoisseurs, alike.   "CAN I EAT SWEET DOE GELATO IF I'M LACTOSE INTOLERANT?        This is the question we are probably asked more often than any other. The short answer is: ask your doctor! But, we're happy to share what we've learned through our own research and experience.        There appear to be many people who have been diagnosed as "lactose intolerant"" without every truly being tested for intolerance to lactose. More often, the intolerance is associated with a specific Casein protein found in cow's milk that is not present in goat's milk. As a result, many people have found that they can enjoy goat milk products, including Sweet Doe Gelato, without experiencing any of the symptoms typically associated with their consumption of products made with cow's milk. In fact, we've had lots of customers who are highly sensitive to cow dairy tell us, with delight, that Sweet Doe Gelato is perfectly fine for them!        That said, goat's milk does contain lactose, so if you are truly lactose intolerant and have been tested by your doctor to confirm it  then you should likely avoid dairy of all types."","F","","","","F","","T","F","","InvtPart","retail pint","F","SDG003","","","38","F","T","","","","","","F","","","","","F","","","15","","F","","per Cs","F","","F","F","","F","F","DEFAULT","","","","Sweet-Doe-Gelato-Goat-Milk-Gelato-Coffee-Case-6-pints","2","213","6","","1","Sweet Doe Gelato / Goat Milk Gelato, Coffee / Case, 6 pints","","","","","","","","852","1","","F","","","","","","","11","","","30.9","F","","F","","REORDER_POINT","Sweet Doe Dairy","6","5","","","","","","F","F","","F","420","","1","Goat Milk Gelato, Coffee","","","","F","","","","F","319","CUMULATIVE_ATP_WITH_LOOK_AHEAD","INGREDIENTS: GOAT MILK, SUGAR, EGG YOLKS, ORGANIC TAPIOCA SOLIDS, GUM ACACIA, GUAR GUM, LOCUST BEAN GUM, VANILLA EXTRACT, VANILLA BEANS","","","","1032","","2","30.9","AVG","3/10/2023","F","F","F","1","F","","F","","","","","F","","Goat Milk Gelato, Coffee / Case, 6 pints","","Average","F","","","","F",""

At Narragansett Creamery, we make cheese everyday because we love to and because we believe in freshness. We use local milk, kind bacteria, vegetable-based rennet, salt and nothing else. While we are not certified organic, we are thoughtful in our actions and our purchases. We support fair-trade and local ingredients to the best of our ability and our farmers pledge to not use growth hormones.

Katalyst Kombucha had been producing kombucha teas since 2005 in Greenfield, Massachusetts, and Green River Ambrosia began producing meads and Ginger Libation at the Katalyst brewery in 2007. After a few years of working together, the owners decided to merge the companies and convert the two businesses into a worker-owned cooperative. Both Katalyst Kombucha and Green River Ambrosia were founded on strong missions to promote environmental stewardship, democratic governance, sustainable agriculture, and building a strong local economy. As each company developed independently it became clear that by fully joining forces the mission of each company could be fulfilled more effectively and all of the operations could become much more efficient.","F","","","","F","","T","F","","InvtPart","keg, 5.2 gallons","F","KAT021","","","32","F","T","","","","","","F","","","","","F","","","","","F","","per EA","F","","F","F","","F","F","DEFAULT","","","","Katalyst-Kombucha-Raspberry-Lime-Kombucha-OG-Bulk-keg-5.2-gallons","1","213","2","","","Katalyst Kombucha / Raspberry Lime Kombucha, OG / Bulk, keg, 5.2 gallons","","","","","","","","591","2","","F","","","","","2","","1","","","54.75","F","","F","","REORDER_POINT","Artisan Beverage Cooperative","1","2","","","","","","F","F","","F","420","","1","Raspberry Lime Kombucha, OG","","","","F","","","","F","319","CUMULATIVE_ATP_WITH_LOOK_AHEAD","","","","","1032","","1","54.75","AVG","3/10/2023","F","F","F","1","F","","F","","","","","F","","Raspberry Lime Kombucha, OG / Bulk, keg, 5.2 gallons","","Average","F","","","","F",""

The chilies are fermented for seven days, then cooked and pureed. Certified organic!  Farmer Made. No Preservatives. Certified Organic.    Our sriracha is a naturally fermented Asian-style chili sauce made from organic peppers grown here at the farm. It has a bright, fruity taste with sharp chili heat and a pronounced garlic flavor. It's delicious on eggs, rice, noodles, in soup, on grilled meats and fish and fried chicken. Kitchen Garden Farm Sriracha comes in 3 varieties: original, extra-hot habanero and super-hot ghost pepper. You can shop online, find us in stores or contact us for wholesale options.        Our Sriracha Is Handcrafted.    We start by selecting fully ripe organic peppers from our fields, which we grind with organic garlic, sugar and salt and allow to ferment for 4-10 days depending on the ambient temperature. After fermentation, the pepper "mash" is heated and passed through a food mill to remove all of the skins and seeds. Then we cook it with vinegar and bottle it. Our sriracha sauce is sealed and shelf-stable but should be refrigerated after opening.","F","","","","F","","T","F","","InvtPart","8oz bottle","F","KGF005","","","85","F","T","","","","","","F","","","","","F","","","19","","F","","per Cs","F","","F","F","","F","F","DEFAULT","","","","Kitchen-Garden-Farm-Sriracha-Habanero-OG-Case-12-x-8oz-bottles","2","213","2","","","Kitchen Garden Farm / Sriracha, Habanero, OG / Case, 12 x 8oz bottles","","","","","","","","595","1","","F","","","","","2","","","","","60","F","","F","","REORDER_POINT","Kitchen Garden Farm","12","1","","","","","","F","F","","F","420","","1","Sriracha, Habanero, OG","","","","F","","","","F","319","CUMULATIVE_ATP_WITH_LOOK_AHEAD","Ingredients: Organic peppers, organic vinegar, organic cane sugar, organic garlic, sea salt, xanthan gum.","","","","1032","","2","60","AVG","3/10/2023","F","F","F","1","F","","F","","","","","F","","Sriracha, Habanero, OG / Case, 12 x 8oz bottles","","Average","F","","","","F",""

When determining which batches to age for 1 Year Cheddar, we look for slightly creamier textures and sweeter flavors that are best showcased in a relatively young cheese.

With an aroma of butter and fresh grass, our 1 Year Cheddar is mellow yet balanced, with aromas of fresh apples and butter. Flavors start off bright and lemony, evolving into a rich and nutty finish that is both comforting and satisfying.

This is a pleasant and mild table cheese; try it paired with fresh grapes or sliced fresh apples for a juicy counterpoint to its rich and buttery flavors. 1 Year Cheddar is also perfect for melting. Flavors becomes milder when melted, so mix with stronger cheeses to add character to a dish, if desired.","F","","","","F","","T","F","","InvtPart","4oz retail pack, wax","F","GVC021","","","5","F","T","","","","","","F","","","","","F","","","1","","F","","per Cs","F","","F","F","","F","F","DEFAULT","","","","Grafton-Village-Cheese-1-Year-Cheddar-Case-12-x-4oz-retail-packs-wax","2","213","6","","1","Grafton Village Cheese / 1-Year Cheddar / Case, 12 x 4oz retail packs, wax","","","","","","","","1429","1","","F","","","","","","","12","","","32.28","F","","F","","REORDER_POINT","Grafton Village Cheese","12","3","","","","","","F","F","","F","420","","1","1-Year Cheddar","","","","F","","","","F","319","CUMULATIVE_ATP_WITH_LOOK_AHEAD","Unpasteurized cow milk, salt, cultures, enzymes","","","","1032","","2","32.28","AVG","3/10/2023","F","F","F","1","F","","F","","","","","F","","1-Year Cheddar / Case, 12 x 4oz retail packs, wax","","Average","F","","","","F",""

About the Apple Balsamic Vinegar of Vermont
 
 
 
 Our Apple Balsamic Vinegar of Vermont (TM) is made from dozens of our own apple varieties, both tame and wild.
 
 
 
 The resulting cider vinegar is sweetened slightly with reduced organic cider. We add no other sugars or colorants. 
 
 
 
 Before bottling, we age and mellow our Apple Balsamic for over a year. Time and handmade barrles with five different woods contribute to its fine flavor.
 
 
 
 Use as you would any other balsamic: as a drizzle, in marinades and glazes, and for a unique twist on a classic and delicious vinagrette.","F","","","","F","","F","F","","InvtPart","","F","SHC005","","","21","F","T","","","","","","F","","","","","F","","","","","F","","per Cs","F","","F","F","","F","F","DEFAULT","","","","Side-Hill-Cider-Mill-Balsamic-Style-Apple-Cider-Vinegar-OG-Case-4-gallons-glass","2","213","6","","","","","","","","","","","2822","2","","F","","","","","2","","","","","9999","F","","F","","REORDER_POINT","Side Hill Cider Mill","","1","","","","","","F","F","","F","420","","","","","","","F","","","","F","319","CUMULATIVE_ATP_WITH_LOOK_AHEAD","Organic apple cider vinegar, reduced Organic apple cider.

This Garlic & Herb Chicken Sausage is prepared from our boneless skinless chicken breasts and combined with just enough of a unique blend of herbs, to make for a delicious clean eating alternative to pork sausage. Each package contains about 4 links and has been air chilled, never bathed in ice water, which can change the texture and dilute the flavor of the meat. There's no need to defrost before cooking - just pan fry or grill, or throw it in the oven!  While traditional pork sausage is high in unhealthy fats and calories, our chicken sausage is lower in calories and fat while being equally as high in protein.   Ingredients: Ground chicken, salt, sugar, minced garlic, black pepper, dry mustard, dill seeds, basil, chives, collagen casing.

The interior is firm and smooth when young and becomes flaky and drier with age. The flavor is buttery, tangy, and even peppery, particularly when aged over 6 months.","F","","","","F","","T","T","","InvtPart","~3# piece","F","PHC029","19.5","","81","F","T","","","","","","F","","","","","F","","","10","","F","","per EA","F","","F","F","","F","F","DEFAULT","","","","Parish-Hill-Creamery-Suffolk-Punch-Piece-3","1","213","6","","1","Parish Hill Creamery / Suffolk Punch / Piece, ~3#","","3","","","","","","762","2","","F","","","","","","","","","","45","F","","F","","REORDER_POINT","Parish Hill Creamery","1","3","","","","","","F","F","","F","420","Pound","1","Suffolk Punch","","","","F","","","","F","319","CUMULATIVE_ATP_WITH_LOOK_AHEAD","","","","","1032","","1","45","AVG","3/10/2023","F","F","F","1","F","","F","","","","","F","","Suffolk Punch / Piece, ~3#","","Average","F","","","","F",""

There appear to be many people who have been diagnosed as "lactose intolerant" without every truly being tested for intolerance to lactose. More often, the intolerance is associated with a specific Casein protein found in cow's milk that is not present in goat's milk. As a result, many people have found that they can enjoy goat milk products, including Sweet Doe Gelato, without experiencing any of the symptoms typically associated with their consumption of products made with cow's milk. In fact, we've had lots of customers who are highly sensitive to cow dairy tell us, with delight, that Sweet Doe Gelato is perfectly fine for them!

Katalyst Kombucha had been producing kombucha teas since 2005 in Greenfield, Massachusetts, and Green River Ambrosia began producing meads and Ginger Libation at the Katalyst brewery in 2007. After a few years of working together, the owners decided to merge the companies and convert the two businesses into a worker-owned cooperative.

The chilies are fermented for seven days, then cooked and pureed. Compared with other sriracha it has an incredibly fresh fruity pepper flavor. Certified organic!  Farmer Made. No Preservatives. Certified Organic.    Our sriracha is a naturally fermented Asian-style chili sauce made from organic peppers grown here at the farm. It has a bright, fruity taste with sharp chili heat and a pronounced garlic flavor. It's delicious on eggs, rice, noodles, in soup, on grilled meats and fish and fried chicken. Kitchen Garden Farm Sriracha comes in 3 varieties: original, extra-hot habanero and super-hot ghost pepper. You can shop online, find us in stores or contact us for wholesale options.    Our Sriracha Is Handcrafted.    We start by selecting fully ripe organic peppers from our fields, which we grind with organic garlic, sugar and salt and allow to ferment for 4-10 days depending on the ambient temperature. After fermentation, the pepper "mash" is heated and passed through a food mill to remove all of the skins and seeds. Then we cook it with vinegar and bottle it. Our sriracha sauce is sealed and shelf-stable but should be refrigerated after opening.","F","","","","F","","T","F","","InvtPart","8oz bottle","F","KGF006","","","85","F","T","","","","","","F","","","","","F","","","19","","F","","per Cs","F","","F","F","","F","F","DEFAULT","","","","Kitchen-Garden-Farm-Sriracha-Original-OG-Case-12-x-8oz-bottles","2","213","2","","","Kitchen Garden Farm / Sriracha, Original, OG / Case, 12 x 8oz bottles","","","","","","","","596","1","","F","","","","","2","","","","","60","F","","F","","REORDER_POINT","Kitchen Garden Farm","12","1","","","","","","F","F","","F","420","","1","Sriracha, Original, OG","","","","F","","","","F","319","CUMULATIVE_ATP_WITH_LOOK_AHEAD","Ingredients: Organic chilies, organic vinegar, organic cane sugar, organic garlic, sea salt, xanthan gum.","","","","1032","","2","60","AVG","3/10/2023","F","F","F","1","F","","F","","","","","F","","Sriracha, Original, OG / Case, 12 x 8oz bottles","","Average","F","","","","F",""

Not only are we mindful to the benefits to the food industry from the growing of cranberries but we are daily reminded that the surrounding support land, whether it be upland or lowland, is a significant resource for the various plants and animals that exist within our borders.Our cranberry products can be found in most of the five star restaurants in Rhode Island and in many grocery stores who feature local products including Whole Foods.","F","","","","F","","T","F","","InvtPart","8oz pouch","F","FFA002","","","64","F","T","","","","","","F","","","","","F","","","","","F","","per Cs","F","","F","F","","F","F","DEFAULT","","","","Fairland-Farms-Dried-Cranberries-OG-Case-12-x-8oz-pouch","2","213","2","","","Fairland Farms / Dried Cranberries, OG / Case, 12 x 8oz pouch","","","","","","","","337","1","","F","","","","","2","","5","","","60","F","","F","","REORDER_POINT","Fairland Farms","12","1","","","","","","F","F","","F","420","","1","Dried Cranberries, OG","","","","F","","","","F","319","CUMULATIVE_ATP_WITH_LOOK_AHEAD","","","","","1032","","2","60","AVG","3/10/2023","F","F","F","1","F","","F","","","","","F","","Dried Cranberries, OG / Case, 12 x 8oz pouch","","Average","F","","","","F",""

A blend of chopped jalapenos, cilantro, parsley, garlic, lemon juice and olive oil, and seasoned with salt, black pepper, cumin and cardamom, if you're not familiar with it yet, you could think of it as a Middle Eastern chimichurri. This general purpose condiment has a bold, spicy flavor that is both hot and tangy, aromatic and herbaceous and brings a savory, rich punch to anything you put it on.

You can use your Zhug as a condiment on almost anything. It is particularly well-suited for Middle Eastern foods such as shawarma, falafel, hummus, and grilled lamb. It is also great on any savory Western dishes as well, such as fish, chicken, beef, as a dip by itself or mixed with yogurt or mayo, as a sandwich spread, or as a marinade.","F","","","","F","8.63302E+11","T","F","","InvtPart","6oz jar","F","BLN002","","","42","F","T","","","","","","F","","","","","F","","","","","F","","per Cs","F","","F","F","","F","F","DEFAULT","","","","Blank-Slate-Kitchen-Zhug-Case-12-x-6oz-jars","2","213","6","","1","Blank Slate Kitchen / Zhug / Case, 12 x 6oz jars","","","","","","","","1421","1","","F","","","","","","","5","","","58.2","F","","F","","REORDER_POINT","Blank Slate Kitchen","12","1","","","","","","F","F","","F","420","","1","Zhug","","","","F","","","","F","319","CUMULATIVE_ATP_WITH_LOOK_AHEAD","jalapeno, cilantro, parsley, lemon juice, garlic, olive oil, salt, black pepper, cumin, cardamon","","","","1032","","2","58.2","AVG","3/10/2023","F","F","F","1","F","","F","","","","","F","","Zhug / Case, 12 x 6oz jars","","Average","F","","","","F",""

Oyster mushrooms may sound more like something you'd find in the ocean than on land. Yet this edible fungus can be beneficial to the body and breaks down toxic chemicals.

Oysters are one of the most versatile mushrooms. They are easy to cultivate and common all over the world. They are also very beautiful, coming in a broad spectrum of colors.","F","","","","F","","T","F","","InvtPart","Retail pint","F","MYC019","","","20","F","T","","","","","","F","","","","","F","","","","","F","","per Cs","F","","T","F","","F","F","DEFAULT","","","","Mycoterra-Farm-Oyster-Rainbow-OG-Case-12-x-retail-pints","2","213","2","","1","Mycoterra Farm / Oyster, Rainbow, OG / Case, 12 x retail pints","","","","","","","","2164","1","","F","","","","","2","","","","","39","F","","F","","REORDER_POINT","Mycoterra Farm","12","2","","","","","","F","F","","F","420","","1","Oyster, Rainbow, OG","","","","F","","","","F","319","CUMULATIVE_ATP_WITH_LOOK_AHEAD","","","87","","1032","","2","39","AVG","3/10/2023","F","F","F","1","F","","F","","","","","F","","Mycoterra Farm / Oyster, Rainbow, OG / Case, 12 x retail pints","","Average","F","","","","F",""

This is the question we are probably asked more often than any other. The short answer is: ask your doctor! But, we're happy to share what we've learned through our own research and experience.        There appear to be many people who have been diagnosed as "lactose intolerant" without every truly being tested for intolerance to lactose. More often, the intolerance is associated with a specific Casein protein found in cow's milk that is not present in goat's milk. As a result, many people have found that they can enjoy goat milk products, including Sweet Doe Gelato, without experiencing any of the symptoms typically associated with their consumption of products made with cow's milk. In fact, we've had lots of customers who are highly sensitive to cow dairy tell us, with delight, that Sweet Doe Gelato is perfectly fine for them!        That said, goat's milk does contain lactose, so if you are truly lactose intolerant and have been tested by your doctor to confirm it  then you should likely avoid dairy of all types.","F","","","","F","","T","F","","InvtPart","retail pint","F","SDG001","","","38","F","T","","","","","","F","","","","","F","","","15","","F","","per Cs","F","","F","F","","F","F","DEFAULT","","","","Sweet-Doe-Gelato-Goat-Milk-Gelato-Chai-Case-6-pints","2","213","6","","1","Sweet Doe Gelato / Goat Milk Gelato, Chai / Case, 6 pints","","","","","","","","850","1","","F","","","","","","","11","","","30.9","F","","F","","REORDER_POINT","Sweet Doe Dairy","6","5","","","","","","F","F","","F","420","","1","Goat Milk Gelato, Chai","","","","F","","","","F","319","CUMULATIVE_ATP_WITH_LOOK_AHEAD","","","","","1032","","2","30.9","AVG","3/10/2023","F","F","F","1","F","","F","","","","","F","","Goat Milk Gelato, Chai / Case, 6 pints","","Average","F","","","","F",""

Starting with a dairy and maple base, the ingredients are slowly churned resulting in a smooth, caramel-like frozen dessert, to be enjoyed on a classic wafer cone. No, it's not "soft serve," it's a creemee. This is our spin on the quintessential maple creemee, but without the dairy, excess sugar, or melting. Enjoy!  Predominantly made from cashews, Maple Creemee uses late-season maple sugar and a hint of pecan and vanilla bean to add complexity and balance. The nutty creaminess of this nut butter replicates both the flavors of the classic Vermont maple creemee, and wafer cone it is traditionally served on.  Ground and Jarred in Vermont.   Ethically-Sourced Vanilla Bean.   Sweetened with Late-Season Vermont Maple Sugar.   Vegan & Paleo Friendly.   Great source of healthy fats and contains 4 grams of protein per serving.

Starting with a dairy and maple base, the ingredients are slowly churned resulting in a smooth, caramel-like frozen dessert, to be enjoyed on a classic wafer cone. No, it's not "soft serve," it's a creemee. This is our spin on the quintessential maple creemee, but without the dairy, excess sugar, or melting. Enjoy!  Predominantly made from cashews, Maple Creemee uses late-season maple sugar and a hint of pecan and vanilla bean to add complexity and balance. The nutty creaminess of this nut butter replicates both the flavors of the classic Vermont maple creemee, and wafer cone it is traditionally served on.  Ground and Jarred in Vermont.   Ethically-Sourced Vanilla Bean.   Sweetened with Late-Season Vermont Maple Sugar.   Vegan & Paleo Friendly.   Great source of healthy fats and contains 4 grams of protein per serving.   No palm oil, refined sugars, or artificial preservatives.","F","","","","F","","T","F","","InvtPart","3.8oz jar","F","MUN004","","","45","F","T","","","","","","F","","","","","F","","","","","F","","per Cs","F","","F","F","","F","F","DEFAULT","","","","Mixed-Up-Nut-Butter-Maple-Creemee-Nut-Butter-NEW-SMALLER-SIZE-Case-12-x-3.8oz-jars","2","213","6","","1","Mixed Up Nut Butter / Maple Creemee Nut Butter / Case, 12 x 3.8oz jars","","","","","","","","664","1","","F","","","","","","","5","","","40.5","F","","F","","REORDER_POINT","Mixed Up Nut Butter","12","1","","","","","","F","F","","F","420","","1","Maple Creemee Nut Butter","","","","F","","","","F","319","CUMULATIVE_ATP_WITH_LOOK_AHEAD","","","","","1032","","2","40.5","AVG","3/10/2023","F","F","F","1","F","","F","","","","","F","","Maple Creemee Nut Butter / Case, 12 x 3.8oz jars","","Average","F","","","","F",""

You may be wondering...what's Mud Season? It's Vermont's infamous fifth season in March and April. A sludgy cocktail of snow, rain, and dirt plague unpaved roads, parking lots, and anything you wear on your feet. The freeze-and-thaw weather cycle makes it ideal for making Vermont's sweetest treat: Maple Syrup. This flavor is muddied with Vermont-roasted coffee, crunchy cacao nibs, flecks of vanilla bean, and a touch of maple sugar. Just like the end of ski season, it's bittersweet and caffeinated. Enjoy!  Ground and Jarred in Vermont. Ethically-Sourced Cacao Nibs and Vanilla Bean. Lightly Sweetened with Late-Season Vermont Maple Sugar. Vegan & Paleo Friendly.

The resulting cider vinegar is sweetened slightly with reduced organic cider. We add no other sugars or colorants.         Before bottling, we age and mellow our Apple Balsamic for over a year. Time and handmade barrles with five different woods contribute to its fine flavor.        Use as you would any other balsamic: as a drizzle, in marinades and glazes, and for a unique twist on a classic and delicious vinagrette.","F","","","","F","","T","F","","InvtPart","8.4oz bottle","F","SHC003","","","21","F","T","","","","","","F","","","","","F","","","","","F","","per Cs","F","","F","F","","F","F","DEFAULT","","","","Side-Hill-Cider-Mill-Balsamic-Style-Apple-Cider-Vinegar-OG-Case-12-x-8.4oz-bottles","2","213","6","","1","Side Hill Cider Mill / Balsamic-Style Apple Cider Vinegar, OG / Case, 12 x 8.4oz bottles","","","","","","","","858","1","","F","","","","","2","","5","","","66","F","","F","","REORDER_POINT","Side Hill Cider Mill","12","1","","","","","","F","F","","F","420","","1","Balsamic-Style Apple Cider Vinegar, OG","","","","F","","","","F","319","CUMULATIVE_ATP_WITH_LOOK_AHEAD","Organic apple cider vinegar, reduced Organic apple cider.

First organized in 1929 with 8 growers, there are now 150 growers with 3,400 acres of Concord grapes, producing about 20,000 tons of Concord grapes each harvest season. We love supporting other Co-Op's and we think you will love this newest flavor in our lineup.  Artisan Beverage Cooperative was founded in 2013 by the owners of Katalyst Kombucha LLC and Green River Ambrosia LLC. Katalyst Kombucha had been producing kombucha teas since 2005 in Greenfield, Massachusetts, and Green River Ambrosia began producing meads and Ginger Libation at the Katalyst brewery in 2007. After a few years of working together, the owners decided to merge the companies and convert the two businesses into a worker-owned cooperative. Both Katalyst Kombucha and Green River Ambrosia were founded on strong missions to promote environmental stewardship, democratic governance, sustainable agriculture, and building a strong local economy. As each company developed independently it became clear that by fully joining forces the mission of each company could be fulfilled more effectively and all of the operations could become much more efficient.","F","","","","F","","T","F","","InvtPart","keg, 5.2 gallons","F","KAT015","","","32","F","T","","","","","","F","","","","","F","","","","","F","","per EA","F","","F","F","","F","F","DEFAULT","","","","Katalyst-Kombucha-Concord-Grape-Kombucha-Bulk-keg-5.2-gallons","1","213","2","","","Katalyst Kombucha / Concord Grape Kombucha / Bulk, keg, 5.2 gallons","","","","","","","","585","2","","F","","","","","","","1","","","54.75","F","","F","","REORDER_POINT","Artisan Beverage Cooperative","1","2","","","","","","F","F","","F","420","","1","Concord Grape Kombucha","","","","F","","","","F","319","CUMULATIVE_ATP_WITH_LOOK_AHEAD","","","","","1032","","1","54.75","AVG","3/10/2023","F","F","F","1","F","","F","","","","","F","","Concord Grape Kombucha / Bulk, keg, 5.2 gallons","","Average","F","","","","F",""
