/**
 * NOTES:
 *   
 *  General structure
 *    - Based in Advanced PDF template that pulls from multiple datasets: invoice data, delivery ticket search data
 *        How do I loop over both sets of data at once while maintaining pdfset? 
 *          pdfset
 *             while (customer/date is the same in invoices)
 *                 print one invoice with a page break 
 *             while (customer/date is the same as invoice customer/date and same as previous in delivery ticket search)
 *                 print delivery ticket
 *                 keep index for next loop
 * 
 * 
 *    - Scripting part based in querying, organizing, and cleaning the datasets to be passed as one step to renderer
 *         - Query on sales orders. Include
 *              route
 *              stop order
 *              attached invoices (ids)
 *              customer
 *              ship date
 *              qty
 *              amount
 * 
 *              sort in order: customer/date
 
 * 
 *         - Run Delivery Ticket search using filters
 *             filters:
 *                  invoice ids (from main query)
 *             sort in order: customer/date
 *
